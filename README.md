The project is primarily supported by two datasets.BSE500 data is included in one dataset, while the income and expenses of random users is included in another dataset.The objective of this project was to use some fundamental knowledge of the stock market and, based on that, to create several levels of investment profiles that users could select, and in return, receive stock recommendations on which they could invest using the money they had available.
